 <summary>See</summary>

Inheritance is the action to based a class on another class.

In Java, we use the word extends.

```
public class Vehicule {...}

public class Car extends Vehicule {...}
```

*Attention* : In Java multiple inheritance is not possible, i,e, a class can only extends one class.

```
public class Mamal {...}

public class Human {...}

public class Person extends Mamal, Human {...} // This is not correct
```


A class can extends an extended class, this is correct:

```
public class Mamal {...}

public class Human extends Mamal {...}

public class Person extends Human {...} 
```

Inheritance is use to create smaller object with well define behavior.


It also helps for code re-use.
