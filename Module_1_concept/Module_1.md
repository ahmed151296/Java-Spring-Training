# Module 1 - Concept

## General

Java is object-oriented programming (OOP) language.

It started in 1995, and we are now (Nov 2022) at version 19.

Java is supposed to be portable, so it compile into bytecode instead of classic computer code.

To read that bytecode, you need a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## New Version

Java now releases a new version every six (6) month.

Long Term Support (LTS) versions are main version supposed to stay and be maintained for a longer period of time (multiple years).

  - takeWhile, dropWhile, iterate
  - Optionals
  - Private method Interface
  - Try with resource
  - HttpClient

- Java 10
  - var -> Type Inference
  - List.of (doesn't accept null value)

- Java 11 - LTS
  - String: isBlank, lines, strip, repeat
  - var for lambdas ((var s1, var s2) -> s1 + s2)
  - writeString, readString

- Java 12
  - Unicode 11

- Java 13
  - Switch

## Variable Scope

The scope of a variable define where in the code a variable can be used.

There are three (3) scopes:

- Global
  The variable is accessible from anywhere in the code

- Function
  The variable is accessible only inside the function, or the class

- Local
  The variable is accessible inside the closest curly bracket ({})

See example ...


## Ternary



## Optional



## Lambda
